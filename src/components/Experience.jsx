                        I maintained and enhanced the full-stack website for the Anglophone Chile project, preserving historical records of 19th-century English-speaking settlers in Chile. I implemented over 20 front-end optimizations, including responsive image scaling and layout refinements, reducing page load time by 15% and improving mobile usability by 20%. I developed an automated email notification system using Django, Celery, Redis, and SMTP, delivering 500+ notifications monthly and increasing user engagement by 30%. Additionally, I streamlined the websiteâ€™s architecture and front-end components using React.js and Django REST Framework (DRF), improving usability scores by 25% based on accessibility testing and user feedback.

                        I developed deep learning models using TensorFlow and SciPy to analyze over 5,000 experimental samples, improving pattern identification by 12% and reducing analysis time by 20%. I built a multi-stage data pipeline integrating Scikit-Learn clustering with Matplotlib and Seaborn to enhance bacterial resistance pattern analysis, achieving 15% better accuracy. Additionally, I designed differential equation models using SciPy numerical solvers to simulate 10,000+ timesteps of experimental data, leveraging SQLite and Jupyter Notebooks for efficient data storage and visualization. I also created Mesa agent-based models with PyTorch regression and MLflow tracking to predict experimental outcomes with 10% higher accuracy across 20 different scenarios.
